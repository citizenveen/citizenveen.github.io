    <h3 class="collapsible"><img class="arrow" src="arrow.png"></img> Original Game <i>KRIEG</i></h3>
    <p class="content">
            The idea for <i>KRIEG</i> was conceived in 2021, when in the wake of the pandemic, conspiracy theorists were very successfully ravaging western democracies (and in many ways, still are). Gone are the days of the lonely 9/11-truther: the conspiracy theorist is a many-headed beast, rooted deeply in flourishing online communities.  The narrative drive of a movement like QAnon mirrors that of the classical <i>Hero's Journey</i>, where every participant is the main character in a heroic quest to save the world. It's a game, with dopamine-rushes in the form of puzzles and trickles of information, and the feeling of being a part of something historical.
            <br>
            <br>We conceptualized a text- and discissions based game that sucks you into a QAnon like conspiracy, in an out of this world science-fiction setting. When you play a game (or watching a movie for that matter), most people rightfully assume all snibbits of information are there for a purpose, that everything is connected, that the character we follow will eventually triumph. Mimicking by default the exact same feeling a conspiracy theorist has regarding the real world.
            <br>
            <br>This is a prototype for <i>KRIEG</i>, consisting of 4 scenes, that should take you 20-40mins to complete. Written by me, created together with Opening Statement and Theater Utrecht's Innovation:Lab team.

        Here are two recent scripts I've written for theatre. Both are in Dutch.
        <br>
        <br><b>CLASS WARFARE FOREVER (2020)</b>
        <br>Class Warfare Forever was born out of a frustration with growing class divide, financial struggle and economic injustice in the Netherlands.
        In a montage of scenes, set between the years 2020 and 2071 we see the lives of Frieda and Reinier, two individuals who both experience the many aspects of these injustice in different, very personal ways. They represent the two main roads of economic class in the Netherlands: labor and housing.
        During the play we also hear the voices of power: an entrepeneur, a politician, an economist. They represent the other side, the people that unknowingly spread ruin, just by the power they wield: wealth, political- and ideological power.

        <br>
        <br><b>WE DOEN ON BEST (2022)</b>
        <br>In <i>We Doen Ons Best</i> two people debate, wonder, talk, doubt and frustrate over everything they hold dear in the face of the impending destruction of climate change.
        Both a highstakes personal kitchen-table-style conversation between two people, and an abstraction of all the voices, opinions and standpoints we hear in the societal debate around climate. <i>We Doen Ons Best</i> was born out of the struggle with how to talk about topics that are too large to phatom. How can we, as single human beings, wrap our heads around the unfathomable changes that stare us in the face.
