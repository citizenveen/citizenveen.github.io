        <h3 class="collapsible"><img class="arrow" src="arrow.png"></img> Original Game <i>KRIEG</i></h3>
        <p class="content">
                The idea for <i>KRIEG</i> was conceived in 2021, when in the wake of the pandemic, conspiracy theorists were very successfully ravaging western democracies (and in many ways, still are). Gone are the days of the lonely 9/11-truther: the conspiracy theorist is a many-headed beast, rooted deeply in flourishing online communities.  The narrative drive of a movement like QAnon mirrors that of the classical <i>Hero's Journey</i>, where every participant is the main character in a heroic quest to save the world. It's a game, with dopamine-rushes in the form of puzzles and trickles of information, and the feeling of being a part of something historical.
                <br>
                <br>We conceptualized a text- and discissions based game that sucks you into a QAnon like conspiracy, in an out of this world science-fiction setting. When you play a game (or watching a movie for that matter), most people rightfully assume all snibbits of information are there for a purpose, that everything is connected, that the character we follow will eventually triumph. Mimicking by default the exact same feeling a conspiracy theorist has regarding the real world.
                <br>
                <br>This is a prototype for <i>KRIEG</i>, consisting of 4 scenes, that should take you 20-40mins to complete. Written by me, created together with Opening Statement and Theater Utrecht's Innovation:Lab team.

        <h3 class="collapsible"><img class="arrow" src="arrow.png"></img> Rewriting <i>Horizon: Zero Dawn</i></h3>
        <p class="content">
            <i>Horizon: Zero Dawn</i> is a 2017 PlayStation action/adventure role playing game. It's a good game, gameplay is fun, original concept, it has a very well-build, detailed, convincing world. The backstory, utter destruction of no less than all life on earth 1000 years before the story of the game takes place, although somewhat grotesque is actually quite convincing and gives a lot of depth to the world.
            <br> The story of the characters of the game within that setting though, is mediocre at best. What it is missing are central elements of classic story writing: interesting and multi-layered characters, a main-character arc that reflects on the values of the world and most importantly, a meaningful conflict. Also, on this wobbly base, the game has difficulties building convincing dialogue. The massive amount of dialogue is represented in awkward choose-your-next-question-style conversation, where characters mostly just explain their inner motives tete-a-tete.
            <br>
            <br> So, both to showcase my writing skills, and the potential of the setting. I decided to rewrite it's story to something more interesting. I also wrote a sample scene. I tried to keep as many elements of the world, characters and names intact, to show what difference just the actual story makes. Having played the game or knowing the original story helps a lot in reading my version.

        <h3 class="collapsible"><img class="arrow" src="arrow.png"></img> Theatre Scripts</h3>
        <p class="content">
            Here are two recent scripts I've written for theatre. Both are in Dutch.
            <br>
            <br><b>CLASS WARFARE FOREVER (2020)</b>
            <br>Class Warfare Forever was born out of a frustration with growing class divide, financial struggle and economic injustice in the Netherlands.
            In a montage of scenes, set between the years 2020 and 2071 we see the lives of Frieda and Reinier, two individuals who both experience the many aspects of these injustice in different, very personal ways. They represent the two main roads of economic class in the Netherlands: labor and housing.
            During the play we also hear the voices of power: an entrepeneur, a politician, an economist. They represent the other side, the people that unknowingly spread ruin, just by the power they wield: wealth, political- and ideological power.

            <br>
            <br><b>WE DOEN ON BEST (2022)</b>
            <br>In <i>We Doen Ons Best</i> two people debate, wonder, talk, doubt and frustrate over everything they hold dear in the face of the impending destruction of climate change.
            Both a highstakes personal kitchen-table-style conversation between two people, and an abstraction of all the voices, opinions and standpoints we hear in the societal debate around climate. <i>We Doen Ons Best</i> was born out of the struggle with how to talk about topics that are too large to phatom. How can we, as single human beings, wrap our heads around the unfathomable changes that stare us in the face.

        <p class="content">
            I can do some entry-level programming. I come from a family of developers, so I figured I couldn't really get away with not knowing any code. So, I thought myself a little web (html/js/css), C, C++, C#. I finished some online courses, most notably Harvards CS50. The page your viewing now I've written in html/css/js from scratch. I've made some simple games in Unity. Working within any game engine, or code-based environment shouldn't be much of a problem.
            <br>
            <br>I also make a pretty mean ramen, or spaghetti alla norma.
